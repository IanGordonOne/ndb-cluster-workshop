# Lab 2 - Create a MySQL Cluster

In this exercise we are going to configure and start the cluster. This can be done from any server, even remotely as long as you can connect to one of the mcmd daemons running on your cluster servers installed earlier.

#### The MCM client

Start the mcm client
If you want to see help run `./mcm/bin/mcm --help`
Our reference manual can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-cluster-manager/1.4/en/mcm-cluster-commands.html).

```
./mcm/bin/mcm
```
