# Lab 6 - Increase capacity of the cluster

There are multiple benchmark tools that you can use to test your cluster, in this workshop we will use the native myqlslap that is included with the distribution.

Benchmark tools available for MySQL Cluster can found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/benchmarks.html)
I recommend using mysqlslap for simple testing, sysbench for more advanced workloads or our flexAsync that uses native API for pushing cluster to the maximum.

Add more data nodes to the cluster
