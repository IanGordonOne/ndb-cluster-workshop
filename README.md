===================

In this workshop, you will learn about MySQL Cluster. This workshop is a blend of presentation and hands-on work.
The presentations can be found in [docs](./docs) folder and hands on work in [labs](./labs) folder.
Feel free to bookmark (star) this page for future testing.

To fully benefit (not mandatory) from hands-on work in this workshop its important that you have some prior experience with databases and are comfortable working in a Linux/Unix environment.

If you want to attend the hands-on work you need to download MCM (Mysql Cluster Manager) as described [here](/labs/prework.md).
